## BTK-Datathon-2023
Submission summary for Datathon 2023, the data science competition organized by BTK Academy.

Datathon 2023 Project Overview

Introduction
This project is part of the Datathon 2023 challenge. It focuses on comprehensive data analysis and visualization using Python. The Jupyter Notebook is organized into various sections, each demonstrating different aspects of data handling and analysis.

Project Structure
1. Data Reading: The initial section of the notebook is dedicated to loading and preparing the dataset for analysis. This is an essential step to ensure data integrity and usability.
2. Importing Libraries for Data Visualization: In this part, we import necessary Python libraries that are crucial for data visualization. Libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or similar ones may be used here to facilitate graphical representation of the data.
3. Data Visualization Based on Specific Attributes: This section showcases the visualization of data based on selected attributes. The aim is to draw meaningful insights by representing the data in various graphical forms.
4. [Further sections to be added as per the content of the notebook].

Technologies Used
1. Python: The primary programming language used for data analysis and visualization.
2. Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
3. NumPy: Essential for numerical operations. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
4. Matplotlib: A plotting library for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.
5. Seaborn: Based on Matplotlib, this library provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
6. Scikit-learn: An essential tool for machine learning in Python. It features various algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, and more.
7. SciPy: Used for scientific and technical computing. It includes modules for optimization, linear algebra, integration, interpolation, special functions, FFT, signal and image processing, and more.
8. Plotly: For creating interactive plots and dashboards. It’s particularly useful when you want to display interactive graphs on a web page.
9. Jupyter Notebook: An open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.

Installation and Usage
