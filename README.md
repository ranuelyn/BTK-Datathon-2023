# BTK-Datathon-2023
Submission summary for Datathon 2023, the data science competition organized by BTK Academy.

Datathon 2023 Project Overview
Introduction
This project is part of the Datathon 2023 challenge. It focuses on comprehensive data analysis and visualization using Python. The Jupyter Notebook is organized into various sections, each demonstrating different aspects of data handling and analysis.

Project Structure
Data Reading: The initial section of the notebook is dedicated to loading and preparing the dataset for analysis. This is an essential step to ensure data integrity and usability.

Importing Libraries for Data Visualization: In this part, we import necessary Python libraries that are crucial for data visualization. Libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or similar ones may be used here to facilitate graphical representation of the data.

Data Visualization Based on Specific Attributes: This section showcases the visualization of data based on selected attributes. The aim is to draw meaningful insights by representing the data in various graphical forms.

[Further sections to be added as per the content of the notebook].

Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language used for data analysis and visualization.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
[Other libraries and technologies used in the project].
